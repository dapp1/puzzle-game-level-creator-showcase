# puzzle-game-level-creator-showcase
## About project
 To create levels for the puzzle game, a user-friendly editor was needed.
 This editor specifies the active area for level construction, ensuring that the game's boundaries are not exceeded.
 In the upper left corner, you can select the tile deletion mode.
 In the lower right corner, there is a panel with tiles; you can click on them to place them on the board. Also next to the map tiles are chips that need to be moved in the game.
 On the right side of the screen, you need to specify the level number and the number of moves required to complete it, achieving a certain number of stars. You also need to save the created level, which will then be used in the game.

 This way, we can load new levels for the player via Firestore, if any.

#### By clicking the button below "Save to Clipboard", the path to the JSON file with the saved levels will be saved.

#### The save is written to a JSON file that stores all levels. Therefore, it's important to specify the correct level number, as it will be overwritten if one already exists.
